# Code for PCon Computing Framework

This repository contains a reference implementation of the algorithms for the paper:

Scalable and Effective Conductance-based Graph Clustering. AAAI2023

## Environment Setup

Codes run on Python 3.7 or later. [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) compiler is recommended because it can make the computations quicker without change the codes.



## Running example
python pcon.py  com-dblp.ungraph.txtid_from_zero
